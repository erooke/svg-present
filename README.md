# Inkscape Presentations

Bad code to produce slides from Inkscape svg files.

## The Idea
Layers are slides, sublayers are used to group slides. 
If a layers label is surrounded in `()` it isn't rendered.
See `examples` for example usage.

## Requirements:
  Must have the following installed:

  - Python 3
  - Inkscape
  - Ghostscript
